<h2>My Story</h2>

By early 2020 I'd spent years working at and running some of the best restaurants and bars in Seattle, and while parts of me loved the F&B industry I knew I wanted a change but wasn't sure how to transition my career. Suddenly in March of that year every bar and restaurant closed it's doors and I had all the free time in the world to sit and think about exactly what I wanted.

While trying to work out what my big move would be I remembered a conversation I had had with a regular when I was tending bar. I mentioned that I was in awe of the things he did but I could never do them, my brain just didn't work like that. He told me I was wrong, my brain could work like that if I wanted it to, I just had to put in the time and have enough grit to keep trying.

So I put him to the test and took a coding class online. I found that after just a few classes that I was obsessing over my code, and that every time I was able to write a functional algorithm I would get a little jolt of adrenaline and excitement. The more I studied, the more I got interested in the nitty gritty of how things worked and I kept finding myself going down these endless rabbit holes which was overwhelming but also empowering, and somewhere down in one of those rabbit holes, after I wrote my first few functional applications, I knew that this was what I wanted to do, and I went all in. In early 2021 I enrolled in an accelerated software development program at Code Fellows, and in September of 2021 I graduated with a countless new tools, frameworks, and languages I can now use to build the kinds of applications I only used to dream about.

<h2>Developer</h2>

I studied Full Stack Developement at Code Fellows with a focus on C#. I am intrigued by server architecture, data management, and scalable systems; but I also love making beautiful and intuitive front-end. When I want to play around with code you can find me in Unity playing with gaming mechanics and phsyics engines or practicing my data structures and algorithms in LeetCode.

C#, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Bash, PowerShell

**Skills and Tools**

.NET Core, Entity Framework, MVC, Razor Pages, React, React-Bootstrap, Git, VS Code, Visual Studio, MongoDB, Axios, Heroku, Netlify, Node.js, Auth0, Expresss, Azure DevOps, Azure SQL, Unity
